    <!--Normally div elements will be displayed on top of each other. However, 
      if we use float: left we can let elements float next to each other:

    <div style="height: 100; width: 200; border:green 1px solid;">

    The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.
    none,left,right,both
